## RESUME
```
- Don't let the list of tests force you to do what you do or the order in which you do it.
- TDD is a fluid process, and you should generally go where the tests suggest you go next. 
```

```
- TDD It’s a tool that accommodates continual experimentation, discovery, and refinement.

- When doing TDD, we sometimes make the mistake of being concerned about premature optimizations.

- Durant the implementation the More important is a good design, with consistent interfaces and expressive code.

- Once you finish implementing correct behavior with a solid design, you might or might not consider optimizing performance.
```

````
- The rule of thumb for TDD is one assert per test. It’s a good idea that promotes focusing on the behavior of the tests, instead of centering tests around functions. 

- A mantra surfaced in the early TDD days that says, “Test everything that can possibly break.”
