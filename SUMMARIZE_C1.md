## RESUME
```
- Don't let the list of tests force you to do what you do or the order in which you do it.
- TDD is a fluid process, and you should generally go where the tests suggest you go next. 
```

```
- TDD It’s a tool that accommodates continual experimentation, discovery, and refinement.

- When doing TDD, we sometimes make the mistake of being concerned about premature optimizations.

- Durant the implementation the More important is a good design, with consistent interfaces and expressive code.

- Once you finish implementing correct behavior with a solid design, you might or might not consider optimizing performance.
```

```
- The rule of thumb for TDD is one assert per test. It’s a good idea that promotes focusing on the behavior of the tests, instead of centering tests around functions. 

- A mantra surfaced in the early TDD days that says, “Test everything that can possibly break.”
```

```
- One thing at a time, however. When test-driving, you want to keep each step in the cycle distinct. When writing a test, don’t go off and refactor. Don’t refactor when trying to get a test to pass, either. 

- A test that passes with no change to your classes is always cause for humility and pause
Ask yourself, “What might I have done differently?”
If a stream of subsequent tests continues to pass, consider reverting your effort.

```

```
- Part of doing TDD well is thinking outside of what we’re given.
